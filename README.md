***Motivation***

Having used many reminder applications to manage our daily tasks, we found out that the most challenging part of such an application is to encourage users to persevere. Oftentimes, users will forget or lack the motivation to tick the boxes after a period of time. How can we encourage users to complete their goals, either short-term or long-term? As both of us are animal lovers, we thought that if such elements can be integrated into the reminder application, we would be more motivated to complete the goals we set. Also, we realised that  by including a section on our application to track long-term goals, it could be very useful in helping users cultivate a healthy lifestyle, such as exercising 30 hours per month. 

***Vision***

Our proposed application is named Onesteps. It will be a reminder mobile application with pet elements integrated. It will also include a gamified component which gives users more incentives to use the application. It will have three interfaces, and pet characters which users can obtain using the points accumulated from completing their tasks. We are also looking to add in interactive features such as feeding to make our application more engaging. Our vision is to help users better manage their tasks. Every step counts no matter big or small, and you just have to make one step per day!

***Aim***

We hope to create an Android and IOS app to help people increase their efficiency and improve living quality in an interesting way.
